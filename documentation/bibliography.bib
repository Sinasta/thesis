    abstract = {In the past, there has been a rapid evolution in computational tools to represent and analyze architectural designs. Analysis tools can be used in all stages of the design process, but they are often only used in the final stages, where it might be too late to impact the design. This is due to the considerable time and effort typically needed to produce the analytical models required by the analysis tools. A possible solution would be to convert the digital architectural models into analytical ones, but unfortunately, this often results in errors and frequently the analytical models need to be built almost from scratch. These issues discourage architects from doing a performance-oriented exploration of their designs in the early stages of a project. To overcome these issues, we propose Algorithmic Design and Analysis, a method for analysis that is based on adapting and extending an algorithmic-based design representation so that the modeling operations can generate the elements of the analytical model containing solely the information required by the analysis tool. Using this method, the same algorithm that produces the digital architectural model can also automatically generate analytical models for different types of analysis. Using the proposed method, there is no information loss and architects do not need additional work to perform the analysis. This encourages architects to explore several design alternatives while taking into account the design’s performance. Moreover, when architects know the set of design variations they wish to analyze beforehand, they can easily automate the analysis process.},

The many different forms of spatial and material partitioning and connectedness found within buildings can be represented by topology. This paper introduces the ‘‘Topologic’’ software library which integrates a number of architecturally relevant topological concepts into a unified application toolkit. The goal of the Topologic toolkit is to support the creation of the lightest, most understandable conceptual models of architectural topology. The formal language of topology is well-matched to the data input requirements for applications such as energy simulation and structural analysis. In addition, the ease with which these lightweight topological models can be modified encourages design exploration and performance simulation at the conceptual design phase. A challenging and equally interesting question is how can the formal language of topology be used to represent architectural concepts of space which have previously been described in rather speculative and subjective terms?},

Given the increased complexity of large scale-projects and the demand for performative buildings, new innovative methods are required to assess the design efficiently. In this paper, we present an alternative and innovative approach to assessing solar radiation intensity on an office building envelope using two machine-learning (ML) models: Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Decision Tree (DT). The experimental workflow of this paper consists of two stages. In the first stage, a generative parametric office tower and its urban context were designed and simulated using Grasshopper software to create a large synthetic dataset of the solar radiation that strikes the office room envelope with several types of analyses. In the second stage, the generated datasets were imported into two ML algorithms (ANN and DT) to create a model for training and testing. The comparison of these two ML models proved that input data types have a significant impact on the accuracy of the prediction and model selection. DT was found to be more accurate than ANN because the data is mostly categorical, which is the most suitable learning background for DT algorithms.},

    abstract = {Some architects struggle to choose the best form of how the building meets the ground and may benefit from a suggestion based on precedents. This paper presents a novel proof of concept workflow that enables machine learning (ML) to automatically classify three-dimensional (3D) prototypes with respect to formulating the most appropriate building/ground relationship. Here, ML, a branch of artificial intelligence (AI), can ascertain the most appropriate relationship from a set of examples provided by trained architects. Moreover, the system classifies 3D prototypes of architectural precedent models based on a topological graph instead of 2D images. The system takes advantage of two primary technologies. The first is a software library that enhances the representation of 3D models through non-manifold topology (Topologic). The second is an end-to-end deep graph convolutional neural network (DGCNN). The experimental workflow in this paper consists of two stages. First, a generative simulation system for a 3D prototype of architectural precedents created a large synthetic database of building/ground relationships with numerous topological variations. This geometrical model then underwent conversion into semantically rich topological dual graphs. Second, the prototype architectural graphs were imported to the DGCNN model for graph classification. While using a unique data set prevents direct comparison, our experiments have shown that the proposed workflow achieves highly accurate results that align with DGCNN’s performance on benchmark graphs. This research demonstrates the potential of AI to help designers identify the topology of architectural solutions and place them within the most relevant architectural canons.},

Furthermore, text-matching is used to determine e.g. room program fulfilment, or assigning functional room descriptions to predefined room types, revealing huge differences of terms throughout time and architects.

This approach offers a unique system of analysis that can create an extensive range of otherwise unexplored solutions to space planning when faced with complex adjacency requirements and a large number of programmatic elements. The Grasshopper script is a significant leap forward over existing research in this area, with the ability for users to define an irregular shaped site boundary, input multiple stories, relate program elements to external adjacencies (views, parking, etc.) and handle an unlimited number of program elements. Consequently, the resulting script can be used as an aid in the schematic design of buildings that have inherently complex programmatic relationships. This article uses a three-story hospital on a sloping site with fifty program elements to demonstrate the efficacy of this approach.},

Field work was carried out in Marrakesh, surveying a number of patio houses which became the Corpus of Design, from where a Shape Grammar was extracted. The computational implementation of the patio house grammar was done within GENE_ARCH. The resulting program was able to generate new, alternative patio houses designs that were more energy efficient, while respecting the traditional rules captured from the analysis of existing houses. After the computational system was fully implemented, it was possible to complete different sets of experiments. The first experiments kept more restrained rules, thus generating new designs that closer resembled the existing ones. The progressive relaxation of rules and constraints allowed for a larger number of variations to emerge.

The accurate representation of the building is an essential requirement for energy analysis, which comes with the expense of time; however, this is in contrast with the need to minimise the simulation time in order to make it compatible with design times. This is a particularly interesting aspect in the case of complex geometries, which are often simplified for use in building energy performance simulation. The effects of this simplification on the accuracy of simulation results are not usually reported. This paper explored these effects through a systematic analysis of several test cases. The results indicate that the use of orthogonal prisms as simplified surrogates for buildings with complex shapes presents a worst-case scenario that should be avoided where possible. A significant reduction of geometry complexity by at least 50\% can also be achieved with negligible effects on simulation results, while minimising the time requirements. Accuracy, however, deteriorates rapidly below a critical threshold.},

While the basis for graph theory in architecture is identical to that in mathematics, architects developed several discipline-specific methods for mapping nodes and edges to various spatial and formal features, and then set out to interpret these maps through a combination of mathematical analysis and observations of human behaviour, social structures and building types. This chapter undertakes a review of architectural applications of graph theory, spanning from its initial use for solving pedestrian circulation problems, through to more recent applications providing insights into access planning, design psychology and way-finding. Through this critical review, three mapping or abstraction techniques, which are a precursor to graph theory analysis, are described and demonstrated. Finally, the chapter identifies three areas that could be the subject of future applications of graph theory in design.},

    abstract = {For architects as well as developers and urban planners working on the floor plans or estimating the shape and dimensions of large buildings is always a challenge. This task requires some knowledge and what is more important – even with understanding of the process it is a very time-consuming task. One should take into consideration the arrangement of all rooms as well as adjacencies and connections of main spaces. Presented project can be considered as an exploration of various ways of generating floor plans for public buildings, which was followed by creating a new algorithm for solving that task. Public buildings were chosen as a main target of conducted research because of their complex and non-standardized structure. The aim was to try different previously described approaches, invent completely new techniques and methods, choose the best of them and incorporate them into our own generator. The creation of working generator prototype was an important target of the project and should not be considered as its final stage, since this trial revealed some positive and negative sides of chosen approach and therefore serves as an intermediate stage. Floor plans analysis was conducted in order to understand the structural patterns of communication spaces in built public houses. One of positive outcomes of this investigation is that public buildings do not share a lot of features in common, therefore this field of exploration is rather unobstructed and provides a lot of possibilities for experiments.},

Due to the complexity of such 3D datasets, the most widespread techniques of 3D scanning and manual building modeling are very time-consuming, which does not allow to have a sufficiently large open-source dataset. We decided to tackle this problem by constructing a field-specific synthetic data generation pipeline that generates an arbitrary amount of 3D data along with the associated 2D and 3D annotations. The variety of annotations, the flexibility to customize the generated building and dataset parameters make this framework suitable for multiple deep learning tasks, including geometric deep learning that requires direct 3D supervision. Creating our building data generation pipeline we leveraged the experts’ architectural knowledge in order to construct a framework that would be modular, extendable and would provide a sufficient amount of class-balanced data samples. Moreover, we purposefully involve the researcher in the dataset customization allowing the introduction of additional building components, material textures, building classes, number and type of annotations as well as the number of views
per 3D model sample. In this way, the framework would satisfy different research requirements and would be adaptable to a large variety of tasks.},

To make room sizes regular and limit the solution set only such grids are used which minimize the number of cells in the smallest room. The description is sufficiently detailed to serve as a basis for programming. Test results for a Pascal implementation of the algorithm are reported. Realistic problems of up to ten rooms have been solved in modest lengths of computer time.

Such constraints are represented by a layout graph. The core component of our learning framework is a deep neural network, Graph2Plan, which converts a layout graph, along with a building boundary, into a floorplan that fulfills both the layout and boundary constraints. Given an input building boundary, we allow a user to specify room counts and other layout constraints, which are used to retrieve a set of floorplans, with their associated layout graphs, from a database. For each retrieved layout graph, along with the input boundary, Graph2Plan first generates a corresponding raster floorplan image, and then a refined set of boxes representing the rooms. Graph2Plan is trained on RPLAN, a large-scale dataset consisting of 80K annotated floorplans. The network is mainly based on convolutional processing over both the layout graph, via a graph neural network (GNN), and the input building boundary, as well as the raster floorplan images, via conventional image convolution. We demonstrate the quality and versatility of our floorplan generation framework in terms of its ability to cater to different user inputs.

K-d tree data structures have primarily been used for nearest neighbor queries and several other query types, for example in database applications. In the context of a research project at the Bauhaus-University Weimar concerned with the development of a creative evolutionary design method for layout problems in architecture and urban design, spatial partitioning with k-d trees has been applied as a partial solution to generate floor plan layouts. Unlike, for example, packing algorithms and slicing tree structures, the employment of k-d tree algorithms in combination with evolutionary algorithms to generate floor plan layouts has not previously been examined in the scope presented here. In the application developed in this project the k-d tree algorithm is initially used to subdivide a given rectangular area. The dividing lines thereby correspond to eventual spatial boundaries. By combining the k-d tree algorithm with genetic algorithms and evolutionary strategies, layouts can – in the current version - be optimized in three criteria dimensions (size, ratio and topology). Through user interaction the layouts can be dynamically adjusted and altered in real time. The result is a generative mechanism that provides an interesting and promising alternative to existing well-established algorithms for the creative and evolutionary solution of layout problems in architecture and urban design.},

However, buildings are typically represented only by their façade, because of the excessive costs it would entail to manually model all interiors. Although automated procedural techniques for building interiors exist, their application is to date limited. One of the reasons for this is because designers have too little control over the resulting room topology. Also, generated floor plans do not always adhere to the necessary consistency constraints, such as reachability and connectivity. In this paper, we propose a novel and flexible technique for generating procedural floor plans subject to user-defined constraints. We demonstrate its versatility, by showing generated floor plans for different classes of buildings, some of which consist of several connected floors. It is concluded that this method results in plausible floor plans, over which a designer has control by defining functional constraints. Furthermore, the method is efficient and easy to implement and integrate into the larger context of procedural modeling of urban environments.},

This research work presents the schema for the organizational graphs, describes the generation algorithms, and analyzes its time/space complexity. As a demonstration, a new dataset called CubiGraph5K is presented. This dataset is a collection of graph representations generated by the proposed algorithms, using the floor plans in the popular CubiCasa5K dataset as inputs. The aim of this contribution is to provide a matching dataset that could be used to train neural networks on enhanced floor plan parsing, analysis and generation in future research.},

We then describe six unique objectives that evaluate each layout based on architectural performance as well as worker-specific preferences. Finally, we show the use of a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) to search through the high-dimensional space of all possible designs, and describe several visualization tools that can help a designer to navigate through this design space and choose good designs. We conclude by discussing the future of such computational workflows in design and architecture.

    abstract = {A lot of attempts have been made in recent years to generate geometrically correct floor plans, spatial configurations and urban layouts in connection with functional relations and defined spatial properties(Elezkurtaj and Franck, 1999) (Duarte, 2001) (Donath, König and Petzold, 2012) (Nourian, Rezvani and Sariyildiz, 2013).Different heuristics (force based drawing...) / optimisations methods (metaheuristic solvers such as genetic algorithms, simulated annealing...)have been applied to search for the »best« trade of between a set of constraint/properties. Most of these techniques are based on an iterative and time consuming process finding a good solution for one, two, maybe three different constraints/properties. But architecture is related to a multitude of different constraints/properties, which strongly depend on the given task and its context. In image processing spectral graph matching has shown to solve different tasks such as graph drawing, image matching and image segmentation. A direct translation to architecture seems obvious as an image similar to a plan represents a particular spatial embedding of elements (pixels, rooms...) in two-dimensional space. As these problems are described through graphs, which represent the relation of elements rather than a particular spatial embedding, these approaches are applicable not only to a two-dimensional space but also in higher dimensions. With such tools at hand, a prototype of a spatial configuration defined by a graph (functional or through properties such as e.g. integration, choice...) can be applied to an existing configuration (e.g. the refurbishment of existing buildings), to a spatial configuration which is generated by other properties than the prototype (e.g. structural, solar gain...) or to the most generic: A grid, resulting in a possible spatial embedding of the prototype. This allows to unlink functional / configuration lconstraint with other properties (an existing configuration, other configurational constraints/properties such as structural, solar...). Through unlinking, each constraint can be looked at on its own, developed on its own to a wanted solution and than relinked again. Further the process of matching two graphs, based on spectral graph theory, is not based on an iterative process but on one with a fixed computational time. Here the bottleneck is the calculation of the eigenvectors which can be preformed at least in O(n^3).},

Through openings and walls, architects manipulate continuities and discontinuities of visual fields in two and three dimensions. Analytical diagrams and models of these fields have been offered by space syntax, especially through visibility graph analysis (VGA), graphing visual relations in two dimensions. This paper introduces a new approach to VGA that departs from planar restrictions. We show how a graph can be generated of inter-visible locations on a planar surface that incorporates relations among elements in three dimensions. Using this method, we extend the current space syntax analysis of architectural space to a new methodology for diagramming and modelling three-dimensional visual relationships in architecture. The paper is structured in three parts. The first section provides an overview of the principles of visibility analysis using graphs, and explains the method by which visibility relations of ‘accessible’ and ‘inaccessible’ space in two and three dimensions are computed. This leads to a graph representation, which uses a mix of ‘directed’ and ‘undirected’ visibility connections, and a new multi-variant spatial categorisation analysis that informs the properties of multi-directional graphs. The second part of the paper tests the three-dimensional visibility model through the analysis of hypothetical and real spatial environments. The third part analyses Giuseppe Terragni’s Casa del Fascio, describing architectural characteristics that are not captured by two-dimensional analysis, and allowing a comparative understanding of spatial configuration in two and three dimensions. The paper concludes with a discussion about the significance of this new model as an analytical and architectural tool.},

Then a sweepline+skyline based heuristic algorithm is proposed to allocate the partitioned spaces to form an orthogonal Voronoi diagram with orthogonal rectangles.

In this research, a part of the EU funded 'Cloud-BIM' project, we applied a novel deep learning technique, graph neural networks (GNNs), to enrich a BIM model, with the goal of testing the applicability of graph representation and the use of GNNs for semantic enrichment. The application scenario concerned classification of room types in apartments. An apartment layout graph dataset containing seven room types and room relationships was compiled from 224 apartment layouts. A high-performance GNN model, GraphSAGE, was selected to train and predict room classes. Despite the small dataset and the sparse relationship features used in the experiment described here, GraphSAGE succeeded in classifying room types with an accuracy of 73\%. This was 12\% higher accuracy than two non-graph machine learning algorithms with which it was compared, and the prediction ability was better balanced. The findings provide clear directions for significantly improving the degree of accuracy by expanding the feature set of both node and edge properties, and this is the subject of ongoing work to refine the use of GNNs for semantic enrichment of BIM models.},

The aim is to train neural networks on datasets with thousands of building design samples and their corresponding performance simulation. The trained model would offer performance prediction for design options emerging in generative protocols. The research is a work-in-progress within a broader project aimed at automating buildings’ environmental performance evaluations of daylight analysis and energy simulation, using deep learning (DL) models. This paper focuses on the implementation of a supervised DL method for automating the retrieval of daylight analysis metrics, targeting successful daylight design and higher building enclosure efficiency. We have further improved a Pix2Pix model trained on 5 different datasets, each containing 6000 paired images of architectural floor plans and their daylight simulation metrics. In the inference phase, the model was able to accurately predict the daylight simulation for unseen sets of floor plans. For validation, two quantitative assessment metrics were followed to assess the predicted daylight performance against the daylight performance simulation. Both assessment metrics showed high accuracy levels.},

For instance, the presence of a room will condition the existence of other rooms, as well as the position of openings between them. First, we attempt here to qualify adjacencies of existing floorplans, to assess the relevance of adjacencies among rooms. We later turn to Bayesian modeling to generate adjacency graphs, either freely or under set constraints.

Spatial configuration is a technical term that refers to the particular way in which a set of spaces are connected to one another as a network. Spatial configuration affects safety, security, and efficiency of functioning of complex buildings by facilitating certain patterns of movement and/or impeding other patterns. In cities and suburban built environments, spatial configuration affects accessibilities and influences travel behavioral patterns, e.g. choosing walking and cycling for short trips instead of travelling by cars. As such, spatial configuration effectively influences the social, economic, and environmental functioning of cities and complex buildings, by conducting human movement patterns. In this research, graph theory is used to mathematically model spatial configurations in order to provide intuitive ways of studying and designing spatial arrangements for architects and urban designers.},

However, while many studies focus on way-finding within environments such as train stations, there are few discussing multi-storey circulation and path-finding within educational institutions. Vertical high schools prefer multiple stairways over elevators, and seek to devote the maximum floor area possible to learning spaces. These considerations impact a student’s ability to quickly traverse multiple floors. In this research, a computational tool is designed to simulate and assess circulation efficiency within a vertical high school with the goal of lightening stairwell congestion and decreasing classroom transit times. Using action research methodology, the research problem was formulated in cooperation with the industry partner, TERROIR, and solved in an iterative manner. As a method to assess spatial circulation performance, principles of graph theory were applied to a simplified navigation mesh derived from the high school’s floor plan and timetable using Grasshopper. The ability to understand the influence of a designer’s decisions on circulation efficiency factors such as travel time and congestion is vital to creating practical and enduring designs that avoid expensive, post-construction building alterations to fix emergent problems—a core contribution of this research. While the simulation designed in this research engages with a vertical high school context, it could be appropriated for other building types, such as offices or shopping centres.},

    abstract = {Graph-based representations of functional requirements (adjacencies, bubble diagram) are a common and useful method that supports architects in the conceptual phase of planning. However, the task of specifying the functional requirements through an adjacency graph can be challenging due to a quadratic growth of complexity in relation to the number of spaces. In turn, this increase of complexity challenges the designer searching for solutions that fulfill these functional requirements. There are systems that aim to address the difficulties related to graph-based space allocation. They, for instance, use fuzzy logic to weight the edges of a graph (i.e., specify relations between spaces) and spring systems (Newtonian gravitation model) to visually clarify the resulting proximity of all spaces according to the rules. Nevertheless, the problem of specifying large-scale adjacencies itself is omitted due to the assumption that such matrices are correctly filled in some previous steps. Moreover, the translation of the resulting graph into a spatial configuration is rarely supported. This work addresses these limitations and proposes a set of tools to assist the designer when defining the adjacency requirements and searching for design solutions that fulfill these requirements. Our approach aims to reduce the complexity of the design task by using graph centrality-based design heuristics. We discuss these heuristics and show their application in a scenario where a new spatial program needs to be allocated into an existing building.},

The approach is applied to building an interactive community design system based on a mobile interface. In the process of building an interactive design system, one of the core problems is to harness the complex topological network formed by user demands. After decades of graph theory research in architecture, a consensus on self-organized complex networks has emerged. However, how to convert input complex topological data into spatial layouts in generative designs is still a difficult problem worth exploring. The paper proposes a way to simplify the problem: in some cases, the spatial network of buildings can be approximated as a collection of sequences based on circulation analysis. In the process of network serialization, the personalized user demands are transformed into activity patterns and further into serial spaces. This network operation gives architects more room to play with their work. Rather than just designing an algorithm that directly translates users’ demands into shape, architects can be more actively involved in organizing spatial networks by setting up a catalogue of activity patterns of the residents, thus contributing to a certain balance of top-down order and bottom-up richness in the project. The research on data serialization lays a solid foundation for the future exploration of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) applied to generative design.},

Where graph models can be automatically generated based on data extracted from Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) models. The aim of this master thesis is to study the potential of using graph databases and the concepts of graph theory to manage, visualize and analyze the information inside BIMs. This can be done through for example through applying data retrieval queries, applying pathfinding algorithms and analyzing the complex relationships between the BIM model entities. The IFC data model is used in the present study to build the graph database; therefore, a brief background on IFC data schema architecture is presented to build-up basic understanding on how IFC models are encoded. This is followed by an introduction to graph theory concepts and graph databases, with the aim to investigate the capabilities of graph models in representing complex and rich datasets such as BIM models. The research proposes a generic approach to create two kinds of graph models: (1) IFC Meta Graph (IMG) model based on the IFC EXPRESS schema and (2) IFC Objects Graph (IOG) model based on STEP physical file format. The IFC EXPRESS schema is used as data source to generate the IMG model to graphically represent the IFC classes and the relationships. The IMG model expresses the classes and their attributes as nodes, and the relationships between them as edges. While, the IFC objects model files are used to build the IOG models, where IFC data are extracted through an IFC data model server and then imported into graph database management system (www.neo4j.com). In both cases of graph modeling, there is a need for a third-party system to enable the data transmission process from the IFC schema/models to Neo4j database. Therefore, the IFC data model server www.ifcwebserver.org has been used to generate the graph query statements scripts and extract the IFC data in form of comma-separated values (CSV) data files for exportation into the Neo4j graph database. This is following by application of graph queries and filters to visualize and analyze building information and to explore the capabilities of graph database in answering realistic questions in building projects particularly. And secondly, to provide a tool for a comparison study of different IFC standard releases or different IFC model versions, when a single graph database is used to storage various IFC models. Finally, the graph model is used for indoor navigation applications in buildings using spatial and geometric information extracted from the IFC model.},

The understanding of topology within architectural design process is based on the mathematical theoretical framework in which the term of continuous deformation of geometric shapes is specified, whose subsequent occurrence in architectural creative work is linked to the increasing use of digital tools in design process and the shift of the dominant philosophical influences in architectural theoretical research. In order to completely perceive the topological method, the theoretical framework ranges between the area of architectural theory of form and architectural design theory, firstly through the explanation of three basic design principles of topological method: deformability, openness and continuity, and secondly through the representation of the models through which the principles occur in the architectural design process. The first part of this work will introduce and analyse the transition of concepts of deformability, openness and continuity, from mathematical topology through philosophy to architecture emphasizing the computational shift in architectural design, while the second part of the work will explain the modalities through which the principles are applied in several architectural design practices. Generally, the paper is conducted in order to determine whether the development of the topological method, as a creative tendency, resulted in forming a unique design strategy due to transformations and adaptations through some authorial design approaches. The topological method design strategy, which involves a complete design approach, is identified as a result of an in-depth research of distinguished methods through three case studies, taking into consideration the complexity of topology within the mathematical area and a complex
transition towards the area of architectural theory. The final question returns to the primarily theoretical framework, seeking to set operating platform for development and use of three strategic principles, which simultaneously indicate the possible directions of future development.},

    abstract = {Andrea Palladio’s Renaissance villas are amongst the most famous and widely stud-
ied examples of domestic architecture ever produced. The majority of past research about Palladio’s architecture employed historical, mathematical and computational methods to analyse their complex proportional systems and rules. In contrast, this paper examines three of Palladio’s arguments about his villas plans which relate to their spatial properties and topological connections. Specifically, this paper uses a computational method - the justified plan graph(JPG) - to test two arguments about the location and significance of the primary salon on the plan, and a third about the extent to which the rooms in Palladio’s plans are, as he claims, flexible enough to contain alternative functions. Using ten of Palladio’s piano nobile (main floor) plans from I Quattro Libri Dell’Architettura as cases, this paper develops mathematical data to test three hypotheses framed around Palladio’s plans and theories.},

    abstract = {Data about building designs and layouts is becoming increasingly more readily available. In the near future, service personal (such as maintenance staff or emergency rescue workers) arriving at a building site will have immediate real-time access to enormous amounts of data relating to structural properties, utilities, materials, temperature, and so on. The critical problem for users is the taxing and error prone task of interpreting such a large body of facts in order to extract salient information. This is necessary for comprehending a situation and deciding on a plan of action, and is a particularly serious issue in time-critical and safety-critical activities such as firefighting. Current unifying building models such as the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), while being comprehensive, do not directly provide data structures that focus on spatial reasoning and spatial modalities that are required for high-level analytical tasks. The aim of the research presented in this paper is to provide computational tools for higher level querying and reasoning that shift the cognitive burden of dealing with enormous amounts of data away from the user. The user can then spend more energy and time in planning and decision making in order to accomplish the tasks at hand. We present an overview of our framework that provides users with an enhanced model of “built-up space”. In order to test our approach using realistic design data (in terms of both scale and the nature of the building models) we describe how our system interfaces with IFC, and we conduct timing experiments to determine the practicality of our approach. We discuss general computational approaches for deriving higher-level spatial modalities by focusing on the example of route graphs. Finally, we present a firefighting scenario with alternative route graphs to motivate the application of our framework.},

    abstract = {Graham’s convex hull algorithm outperforms the others on those distributions where most
of the points are on or near the boundary of the hull (Allison and Noga, 1984). To use this
algorithm for ﬁnding an orthogonal convex hull of a ﬁnite planar point set, we introduce
the concept of extreme points of a connected orthogonal convex hull of the set, and show
that these points belong to the set. Then we prove that the connected orthogonal convex
hull of a ﬁnite set of points is an orthogonal (x, y)-polygon where its convex vertices are
its connected orthogonal convex hull’s extreme points. As a result, an eﬃcient algorithm,
based on the idea of Graham’s convex hull algorithm, for ﬁnding the connected orthogonal
convex hull of a ﬁnite planar point set is presented. We also show that the lower bound
of computational complexity of such algorithms is O(n log n ). Some numerical results for
ﬁnding the connected orthogonal convex hulls of random sets are given.},
